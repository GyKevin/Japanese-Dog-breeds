<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">The Kai dog is the most unusual looking of the Japanese native dogs due to their striking brindle coat.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">Their brindle coat also allowed the Kai to have the coolest nickname, “tiger dog” stemming from the Japanese word for brindle torage, or tiger fur.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">Although the Kai like the Hokkaido is classified as a medium sized dog, some argument has been made about the two dogs being slightly too small for the medium category.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">The Kai dog’s coat comes in three colors, black brindle, red brindle, and medium brindle. The most common color being black.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">Due to the isolated and inaccessible region of their origins, the Kai’s dog bloodline has remained virtually untouched and pure.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">Physically, the Kai is highly athletic, well-balanced, and sturdily built. Their well developed muscles likely evolving from living in tough, mountainous regions.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">The Kai was bred to be a superb hunter of mountain antelope, wild boar, deer, and pheasant. The hunting families survival largely depended on their hunting dogs ability to track and kill game.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">Today, this hunting instinct largely remain with the Kai being alert, quick thinking, and ready to pounce at an moment.</font></p></center>

<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">The temperament of a Kai dog is similar to the other native dogs - independent, loyal - but fierce.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">It has been said that a Kai will fight to death in order to protect it’s master. </font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">And although a Kai might look wild, they are said to be highly perceptive and sensitive to their owner’s feelings.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">Thanks to national and prefectural government protection, the Kai is one of the few native dogs to remain mostly unaffected by World War II.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">The government even offered tax incentives to owners of Kai dogs in order to protect their national treasures.</font></p></center>
