<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">The Kishu Ken is the most popular native Japan dog breed in the medium-sized category.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">However, even in Japan, Kishu is still quite rare.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">The Kishu is the Japan dog that is most often used in modern day hunting.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">Although Kishu originally had coat colors similar to other native dogs, nearly all of todayâ€™s Kishu are white. This occurred when breeders heavily breeded the Ouchiyama line of white Kishu.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">The Ouchiyama Kishu were remarkable hunters despite being easier to see by prey. This disadvantage was counterbalanced by the fact that hunters had an easier time tracking their Kishu.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">The hunting prowess of the Kishu made them treasured family members of hunters for centuries. Painting from over seven hundred years ago show depictions of hunters with their Kishu dogs hunting wild boar.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">This reverence for their dogs and the fact that they were situated in isolated mountains helped the Kishu to survive World War II relatively unharmed. Out of the medium-sized <center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">Japan dog breeds, the Kishu is slightly heavier with more developed muscles.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">The Kishu is a natural athlete with a strong desire to hunt. They are powerful, fast, and keenly alert at all times.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">Temperament wise, they share the same traits as the other Nihon Ken - independent, aloof, and one-owner dogs. They are thought of as to be a bit more friendly than the other native breeds.</font></p></center>

<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">Yet, the Kishu is also known to quiet, cunning predators patiently waiting for prey to appear.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">The Kishu is similar to the Shikoku due to the two breeds having primitive, wolf-like characteristics. </font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">There are legends and lores that say that both Kishu and Shikoku were descended from wolves as well.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">These two breeds also have the purest bloodlines due to the isolated region of their origins.</font></p></center>
