<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">The Akita Inu is the largest of the six native Nihon Ken and the only dog in the large category. In fact originally all Japanese dogs were only small to medium sized.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">The Akita Inu originated from the Akita region of Japan and were originally medium-sized bear hunting dogs.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">They were used extensively as fighting dogs and to increase their size and power - were crossed with Mastiffs,Tosas, and western dogs  in the mid-19th century.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">The Akitas size increased, pushing them into the large category, but at the expense of losing most of it’s original Spitz type characteristics.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">War and disease caused more problems for the Akita and almost led them to extinction.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">Fortunately, with much difficulty and effort, Japanese Akita preservationists were able to mainly restore the Akita Inu to it’s original pure strain.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">Currently, the Akita Inu is still very much a rare breed - even in it’s own country.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">Acquiring an Akita Inu outside of importing from Japan is possible but very expensive. In fact, Akita Inus are known to be one of the most expensive dog breeds to purchase.

<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">The Akita is an independent, confident, and reserved dog.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">They are loyal and protective of their family members - almost to a fault.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">The sheer size and dominating nature of Akitas make them suitable only for certain dog owners who can understand and manage a primitive breed type dog like an Akita.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">Akitas are a territorial breed and like many other primitive breeds, do not cohabit well with members of the same sex.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">Socialization and early training is essential for the health of the Akita as well as for the safety of the human family members.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">While well trained and socialized Akitas should be behaved and unaggressive - some poorly trained Akitas can be aggressive and dangerous if not managed properly.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">In the U.S, and certain other countries, Akitas are labeled as dangerous dogs which can impede an owners choice of housing.</font></p></center>
