<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">Of the six native Japanese dogs, the Hokkaido dog or Hokkaido Inu is thought to have more of the older genes originating from the earliest of their ancestors - the original Jomon dog.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">The Hokkaido Inu is mostly known to the Japanese as the Hokkaido Ken or Hokkaido with the word Ken simply translating to dog.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">The Hokkaido is medium sized dog slightly larger than a Shiba Inu and shares similar physical features.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">Because of the frigid temperatures of the Hokkaido region, Hokkaido dogs have a thicker outer coat and a denser undercoat.</font></p></center> 
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">The harsh environment also allowed the Hokkaido to have larger paws and smaller ears to deal with snow and the unforgiving bitter cold.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">Hokkaido coat colors include white, red, black, brindle and wolf grey.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">The Hokkaido was bred to be a fierce hunting dogs, capable of handling small bears with ease. The indigenous Ainu people revered their “bear” dogs for their unwavering loyalty, bravery, and hunting ability.

<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">Although rarely used in bear hunting today, organizers of dog shows in Japan still show captive bears to the Hokkaido to test their “bear” drive.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">This storied hunting past has produced a Hokkaido that still shows tremendous physical fortitude, alertness, and keen judgement.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">Temperament wise, the Hokkaido is strong-willed, wary of strangers and fiery at times. They are also sensitive dogs and with the right training can be very obedient dogs.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">However, like the other six native Japanese dogs, Hokkaido’s are usually “one-owner” dogs and can display both human and dog aggression.</font></p></center>
<center><p style="color:white;"><font size="4">Hokkaido’s forge strong bonds with their owners and require attention and affection from their master. Although not typically a barking dog, the Hokkaido is known to howl or sing in delight upon the return of their master.</font></p></center>
